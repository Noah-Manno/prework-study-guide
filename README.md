# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage to help overwhelmed bootcamp enrollees organize and review what they have learned from the prework. It provides a quick overview of the important ideas, functions, and algorithms which were discussed during the prework. In doing so, I learned the basic of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in order to create the webpage.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to prepare for the start of bootcamp. Each section of the webpage contains notes about four different topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

If you open the DevTools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), you can see some JavaScript at work. It will list the topics which this study guide includes, and it will also choose a topic which you can study first.
